# Theatre-Runner

Dillon is my partner. 

In this project, the purpose of this project is to run an animation of Jack Black running through the Minecraft world, reaching the Nether portal, and reaching the Nether. 

There are 3 classes: ImageScene, SceneImage, ImagePlus

The methods all contribute to the constant change of the elements shown on the theatre. From the moving Jack Black picture, to the stationary background images, all of these contribute to the output of the program. 

If we had more time, we would make more scenes for the animation; adding more scenes that relate to the natural progression of the game.
